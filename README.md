## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ships with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

This code example consists of two parts: a locator and a target.

For the locator, download and install the LightBlue® app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lightblue/id557428110) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.punchthrough.lightblueexplorer&gl=US).

You can also use other Android or iOS apps that support the IAS service.

Scan the following QR codes from your mobile phone to download the LightBlue app.

![](./images/qr.png)

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en). all other required software come bundled with the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[Bluetooth&reg; LE findme](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-ble-findme)" application with the desired name "MyBluetoothLEFindme" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-ble-findme --user-app-name MyBluetoothLEFindme --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyBluetoothLEFindme" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyBluetoothLEFindme" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. To run the application on CM0+ core of PSoC&trade; 6, open **Makefile** in the application and change CORE=CM0P. By default, the application uses CM4 core. 

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth stack and application trace messages in the terminal window:

   **Figure 1. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

   ![](images/figure3.png)

6. To test using the LightBlue mobile app, do the following (see equivalent LightBlue app screenshots in Figure 2 and Figure 3):

   1. Turn ON Bluetooth on your Android or iOS device.

   2. Launch the LightBlue app.

   3. If it is present on the kit, CYBSP_USER_LED2 will start blinking to indicate that advertising has started. Advertising will stop after 90 seconds if a connection has not been established and CYBSP_USER_LED will turn off.

   4. Swipe down on the LightBlue app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE peripherals; your device (“Find Me Target”) appears in the LightBlue app home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection. Once the connection is established, CYBSP_USER_LED2 changes from blinking state to always ON state.

   5. Select the 'Find Me Profile' from the carousel view.

   6. Select an Alert Level value on the Find Me Profile screen. Observe the state of CYBSP_USER_LED1 on the device; it changes based on the alert level.

      **Figure 2. Testing with the LightBlue app on iOS**

      ![](images/figure1.png)

      <br />

      **Figure 3. Testing with the LightBlue app on Android**

      ![](images/figure2.png)


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

The ‘Find Me Locator’ (the Bluetooth&reg; LE Central device) is a Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client. The ‘Find Me Target’ (the Peripheral device) is a Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server with the IAS implemented, as Figure 4 shows.

**Figure 4. Find Me Profile (FMP) implementation**

![](images/figure4.png)

The Bluetooth&reg; LE Find Me Profile defines what happens when the locating Central device broadcasts a change in the alert level.

The Find Me Locator performs service discovery using the "GATT Discover All Primary Services" procedure. The Bluetooth&reg; LE Service Characteristic discovery is done by the "Discover All Characteristics of a Service" procedure. When the Find Me Locator wants to cause an alert on the Find Me Target, it writes an alert level in the Alert Level characteristic of the IAS. When the Find Me Target receives an alert level, it indicates the level using the CYBSP_USER_LED1: OFF for no alert, blinking for mild alert, and ON for high alert.

**Figure 5. Find Me Profile (FMP) process flowchart**

## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example.

- **Device configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; software stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the device configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP refer to the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-ModusToolbox_User_Guide-Software-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c66a4767a&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files). In this example we are using the default configuration. See the [Device configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Device_Configurator_Guide_4-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99ab297631cb&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files).

- **Bluetooth&reg; configurator:** the Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   Note that unlike the device configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. As explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section, the only extra service added is the Immediate Alert Service (IAS). See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator Guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Bluetooth_Configurator_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99aaf5b231be&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files).

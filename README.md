## Hardware Setup
This example uses the kit’s default configuration. See the respective kit guide to ensure that the kit is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ships with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the Firmware Loader GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup
This code example requires two devices: a Locator(Mobile Phone or PC) and a Target( Cypress Kit).

For the Locator, download and install the CySmart™ app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cysmart/id928939093?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cypress.cysmart&hl=en).

You can also use the [CySmart Host Emulation Tool](http://www.cypress.com/go/cysmart) Windows PC application if you have access to the [CY5677 CySmart BLE 4.2 USB Dongle](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy5677-cysmart-bluetooth-low-energy-ble-42-usb-dongle). You can also use other Android or iOS apps that support the IAS service.

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click on the link from the Quick Panel.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** Ensure that the *deps* folder contains the required BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) corresponding to the TARGET. Use the Library Manager (`make modlibs` command) to select and download the BSP file. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to download or clone the repository, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.



## Operation
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings.

   Baud rate : 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity : None; Stop : 1 bit; Flow control : None; New line for receive data : Line Feed(LF) or Auto setting

3. Program the board.
   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.


   - **Using CLI:**

      From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:

      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:

      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
      
        **Note:**  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth stack and application trace messages in the terminal window as shown in Figure 3.

     **Figure 3. Log Messages on KitProg3 COM Port**
     ![Figure 3](images/figure3.png)

5.	To test using the CySmart mobile app, do the following (see equivalent CySmart app screenshots in Figure 1 and Figure 2):

    1. Turn ON Bluetooth on your Android or iOS device.

    2. Launch the CySmart app.

    3. If it is present on the kit, CYBSP_USER_LED2 will start blinking to indicate that advertising has started. Advertising will stop after 90 seconds if a connection has not been established and CYBSP_USER_LED will turn off.

    4. Swipe down on the CySmart app home screen to start scanning for BLE Peripherals; your device (“Find Me Target”) appears in the CySmart app home screen. Select your device to establish a BLE connection. Once the connection is established, CYBSP_USER_LED2 changes from blinking state to always ON state.

    5. Select the 'Find Me' Profile from the carousel view.

    6. Select an Alert Level value on the Find Me Profile screen. Observe the state of the CYBSP_USER_LED1 on the device; it changes based on the alert level.

         **Figure 1. Testing with the CySmart App on iOS**
         ![Figure 1](images/figure1.png)

         **Figure 2. Testing with the CySmart App on Android**
         ![Figure 2](images/figure2.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

**Note:**
Debugging is of limited value when there is an active BLE connection because as soon as the BLE device stops responding, the connection will get dropped.

## Design and Implementation
The ‘Find Me Locator’ (the BLE Central device) is a BLE GATT Client. The ‘Find Me Target’ (the Peripheral device) is a BLE GATT Server with the IAS implemented, as Figure 4 shows.

**Figure 4. Find Me Profile (FMP) Implementation**
![Figure 4](images/figure4.png)

The BLE Find Me profile defines what happens when the locating Central device broadcasts a change in the alert level.

The Find Me Locator performs service discovery using the "GATT Discover All Primary Services" procedure. The BLE Service Characteristic discovery is done by the "Discover All Characteristics of a Service" procedure. When the Find Me Locator wants to cause an alert on the Find Me Target, it writes an alert level in the Alert Level characteristic of the IAS. When the Find Me Target receives an alert level, it indicates the level using the CYBSP_USER_LED1: OFF for no alert, blinking for mild alert, and ON for high alert. Refer to Figure 5 for the process flow chart.

## Resources and Settings
This section explains the ModusToolbox resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder. By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly. To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP refer to the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/504361/download). In this example we are using the default configuration.
For detailed information on how to use the Device Configurator, see the
[Device Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth Configurator:** The Bluetooth peripheral has an additional configurator called the “Bluetooth Configurator” that is used to generate the BLE GATT database and various bluetooth settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*. Note that unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. As explained in the design and implementation section the only extra service we have added is the Immediate Alert Service (IAS).
For detailed information on how to use the Bluetooth Configurator, see the [Bluetooth Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

## Hardware setup

This example uses the kit’s default configuration. See the respective kit guide to ensure that the kit is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ships with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

This code example requires two devices: a locator (mobile phone or PC) and a target(Infineon kit).

For the locator, download and install the CySmart app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cysmart/id928939093?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cypress.cysmart&hl=en).

You can also use the [CySmart host emulation tool](http://www.cypress.com/go/cysmart) Windows PC application if you have access to the [CY5677 CySmart Bluetooth&reg; LE 4.2 USB dongle](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy5677-cysmart-bluetooth-low-energy-ble-42-usb-dongle). You can also use other Android or iOS apps that support the IAS service.

Scan the following QR codes from your mobile phone to download the CySmart app.

![AppQR](images/qr.png)

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en). all other required software come bundled with the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following table lists the arguments for this tool:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional


The following example will clone the "[Bluetooth&reg; LE find me profile](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-anycloud-ble-findme)" application with the desired name "mtb-example-anycloud-ble-findme" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062-4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --app-id mtb-example-anycloud-ble-findme --user-app-name mtb-example-anycloud-ble-findme --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For more details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings.

   Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receive data: Line Feed(LF) or auto setting

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

   **Note**: Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth stack and application trace messages in the terminal window:

   **Figure 1. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

   ![](images/figure3.png)

5. To test using the CySmart mobile app, do the following (see equivalent CySmart app screenshots in Figure 2 and Figure 3):

   1. Turn ON Bluetooth on your Android or iOS device.

   2. Launch the CySmart app.

   3. If it is present on the kit, CYBSP_USER_LED2 will start blinking to indicate that advertising has started. Advertising will stop after 90 seconds if a connection has not been established and CYBSP_USER_LED will turn off.

   4. Swipe down on the CySmart app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE peripherals; your device (“Find Me Target”) appears in the CySmart app home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection. Once the connection is established, CYBSP_USER_LED2 changes from blinking state to always ON state.

   5. Select the 'Find Me Profile' from the carousel view.

   6. Select an Alert Level value on the Find Me Profile screen. Observe the state of CYBSP_USER_LED1 on the device; it changes based on the alert level.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

**Note:** Debugging is of limited value when there is an active Bluetooth&reg; LE connection because as soon as the Bluetooth&reg; LE device stops responding, the connection will get dropped.


## Design and implementation

The ‘Find Me Locator’ (the Bluetooth&reg; LE Central device) is a Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Client. The ‘Find Me Target’ (the Peripheral device) is a Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server with the IAS implemented, as Figure 4 shows.

**Figure 4. Find Me Profile (FMP) implementation**

![](images/figure4.png)

The Bluetooth&reg; LE Find Me Profile defines what happens when the locating Central device broadcasts a change in the alert level.

The Find Me Locator performs service discovery using the "GATT Discover All Primary Services" procedure. The Bluetooth&reg; LE Service Characteristic discovery is done by the "Discover All Characteristics of a Service" procedure. When the Find Me Locator wants to cause an alert on the Find Me Target, it writes an alert level in the Alert Level characteristic of the IAS. When the Find Me Target receives an alert level, it indicates the level using the CYBSP_USER_LED1: OFF for no alert, blinking for mild alert, and ON for high alert.

## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example.

- **Device configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; software stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the device configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP refer to the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/504361/download). In this example we are using the default configuration. See the [Device configurator guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; configurator:** the Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   Note that unlike the device configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. As explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section, the only extra service added is the Immediate Alert Service (IAS). See the [Bluetooth Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

**Table 1. Application resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port|
| GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_LED1         | Changes state depending on the alert level|
| GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_LED2         | Depicts device states|
| PWM (HAL)    | adv_led_pwm        | PWM HAL Object for controlling advertising LED (CYBSP_USER_LED2)|
| PWM (HAL)    | ias_led_pwm        | PWM HAL Object for controlling alert level LED (CYBSP_USER_LED1)|
